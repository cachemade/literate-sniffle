    <h1>The Origin </h1>
    <p>You are the accumulation of memories, culture, values, ever rewriting yourself with each moment lived.
    <p>To be human is to be shaped by what we aspire, love, and remember, written into us over time.</p>
    <p> The internet has become an extension of memory and identity. What we search, share, and save reflects back at us, shaping how we see ourselves.</p>
